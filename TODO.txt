Things that need to be done, in no particular order:

* 2010/12/03: Create an AVL-Tree or B-Tree to map particle vids to
              the actual particle data.
* 2010/12/03: Somehow add bonded interactions to cell pairs or some
              mechanism to treat bonds, angles and torsions in parallel
* 2010/12/03: Keep track of particles that wander into a ghost layer
              or out of the domain (is this really needed?).
* 2010/12/09: Add SSE2 vectorization for double.
* 2010/12/10: Add OpenMP to configure script.
* 2010/12/11: Add Cell/BE to the configure script, modify the spu/Makefile
              to make a Makefile.in using whatever directory the Cell/BE
              toolkit is in.
* 2010/12/11: Let the Cell/BE version also use tuples (is this really
              necessary?).
* 2010/12/11: Create PPU runners if all SPUs are full in CELL mode (check
              return value of spe_context_create to see when this is the
              case).
