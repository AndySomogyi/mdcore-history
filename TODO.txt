Things that need to be done, in no particular order:


Things to do with useability

* 2010/12/14: Find a way to set OMP_WAIT_POLICY=PASSIVE in test.c.


Things to do with functionality:

* 2010/12/03: Create an AVL-Tree or B-Tree to map particle vids to
              the actual particle data.
* 2010/12/03: Somehow add bonded interactions to cell pairs or some
              mechanism to treat bonds, angles and torsions in parallel
* 2010/12/03: Keep track of particles that wander into a ghost layer
              or out of the domain (is this really needed?).
* 2010/12/11: Let the Cell/BE version also use tuples (is this really
              necessary?).
* 2010/12/11: Create PPU runners if all SPUs are full in CELL mode (check
              return value of spe_context_create to see when this is the
              case).
              
              
Things to do with the configuration process:

* 2010/12/10: Add OpenMP to configure script.
              
             
Things to do with testing:
              
* 2010/12/12: Test new shifted/linear potentials for Cell/BE (packing?)


Thins to do with speed:

* 2010/12/09: Add SSE2 vectorization for double.
* 2010/12/14: Use local on-stack copy of eng->p in runner_dopair and
              runner_sortedpair?
* 2010/12/14: Write-back force of outer-loop particle only at the end
              of the outer loop?
* 2010/12/14: Make potential data aligned to 64-byte boundary s.t. the
              data for each interval fits in a single cache line.
