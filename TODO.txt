Things that need to be done, in no particular order:

* 2010/12/03: Create an AVL-Tree or B-Tree to map particle vids to
              the actual particle data.
* 2010/12/03: Somehow add bonded interactions to cell pairs or some
              mechanism to treat bonds, angles and torsions in parallel
* 2010/12/03: Keep track of particles that wander into a ghost layer
              or out of the domain.
* 2010/12/03: Add more elaborate error reporting mechanism (e.g. as in
              libchebfun).
* 2010/12/09: Add SSE2 vectorization, check speedup for single and double.
