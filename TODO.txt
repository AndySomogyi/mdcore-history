Things that need to be done, in no particular order:

* 2010/12/03: Create an AVL-Tree or B-Tree to map particle vids to
              the actual particle data.
* 2010/12/03: Somehow add bonded interactions to cell pairs or some
              mechanism to treat bonds, angles and torsions in parallel
* 2010/12/03: Keep track of particles that wander into a ghost layer
              or out of the domain (is this really needed?).
* 2010/12/09: Add SSE2 vectorization for double.
* 2010/12/10: Add OpenMP to configure script.
